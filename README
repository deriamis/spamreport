ABOUT

    This build system produces a 'fatpacked' Perl script that, with some file
    assets for geolocation purposes, is useful for reporting on and
    investigating sources of spam and of other anomalous email usage.

    spamreport's documentation is in spamreport --man; briefer information is
    in spamreport --help.

BUILDING (for the first time ever)

    make          # this will work for a bit and then fail
    make depend
    make

BUILDING

    make

(RE)BUILDING

    If only the existing SpamReport modules are changed, 'make' is enough
    to rebuild build/spamreport.  If modules have changed, you may need to edit
    cpanfile and then run 'make distclean' before running 'make', to get the
    new dependencies.

BUILD REQUIREMENTS

    cpanm and perl must be in PATH

DISTRIBUTION

    The following files in build/ must exist in /root/bin:

        spamreport
        ipscountry.dat
        ip.gif
        cc.gfi

    You can then run spamreport as normal.  It will create files under
    /opt/hgmods/logs , and will create this directory if necessary.  If --dump is
    provided, spamreport will check to ensure that the destination is
    reasonable (it exists; it's owned by root), but will otherwise place mode-0600
    files where requested.

    NB. you can run spamreport from anywhere, but those assets must be in
    /root/bin .

USAGE

    See: spamreport --help

ALTERNATE USAGE

    spamreport tries to behave in a eigshell-appropriate way if $RUSER is
    unset.  (Presently this only means that some messages are suppressed.)

    spamreport duplicates ecpp's flags and behavior if $0 is 'ec'

CACHE

    spamreport expects that, once a calendar day, the following command will be run:

        spamreport --cron

    and that at regular intervals over the course of a day, that the following
    command is also run:

        spamreport --update

    These commands maintain A) a partial cache with just prior days' email
    information, and B) a complete cache of all email information at the time of
    invocation.

    Most other investigative and reporting commands load just the prior days'
    cache and then actively scan system log files and queues for current
    information about the current calendar day.  With --latest , and in some
    other cases, the complete cache is loaded and log-scanning is skipped as
    much as possible.

    If these cache files don't exist or are too old, spamreport will try to
    make do.

    Normal commands also update the complete cache, just like --update, when
    this is sensible and when they have the information anyway.

    The cache files are gzip-compressed Storable files.  Use --dump if you want
    readable YAML files as well.
